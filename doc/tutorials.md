simpleTest
--

Tutorial for the __eulerianFilteredTFM__ solver. Simple configuration to test new implementation (useful for unit tests). 

sideInjection_simple
--

Tutorial for the __eulerianFilteredTFM__ solver. Particles are injected into a very short riser and fluidised by the air flow. This case is useful for testing purposes.

sideInjection
--

Same as sideInjection_simple, but a longer and hence more realistic riser. Note, the 'importCase.sh' script will import the settings from case 'sideInjection_simple' (except for the dictionaries that control mesh building!)
