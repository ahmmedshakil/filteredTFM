Molecular stress sub-closure
==

Description
--
This closure uses the molecular viscosity to compute the stress tensor as in standard
single-phase laminar flows. It is generally appied as micro-scale closure for
the continuous phase.

Syntax
--
No additional entries are required.

Examples
--
In [stressClosure](../../ClsStress.md):

```
      microScale
      {
          type molecular;
      }
```
